Demo of Google+ sign-in for PhoneGap

By adding Google+ Sign-In, you bring the power of Google to your Application. When a user is signed in, you get an OAuth token for making API requests on their behalf, which you can use to better understand your user, connect them with their friends, and create a richer and more engaging experience.

Step 1: For Google+ we we need to create our app on Google first, so go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/console/project/209773850925?redirected=true) and Add New Project

Step 2: Go to the services tab and enable Google+ API

Step 3: Go to the API Access tab and create new Client ID

Step 4: Now that the new client id with token and secret are generated, replace the '[client_id]' and '[client_secret]' in _index.js_ with the copied values from the API access screen
